# XTB Report Analyzer

**XTB Report Analyzer** is a tool designed to parse xlsx reports from XTB broker accounts, serialize them to JSON format, and import them into a PostgreSQL database. It provides an interactive terminal interface to query and visualize investment data, allowing for comprehensive data analysis directly from the command line.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three main modules:

1. **XLSX-to-JSON Converter** \
This module reads xlsx reports exported from XTB broker, parses their structure, and converts them into JSON format. The module includes validation of the input xlsx file to ensure the completeness and integrity of the data, enabling seamless integration with the database.
Output: A validated JSON object ready for further processing or direct import into the database.

2. **PostgreSQL Data Importer** \
This module takes the JSON data generated by the xlsx-to-JSON Converter and imports it into a PostgreSQL database. It manages the creation of necessary database tables, maps JSON objects to appropriate tables and columns, and supports batch imports for handling larger datasets.

3. **Terminal Query Interface** \
An interactive terminal interface that connects to the PostgreSQL database, allowing the user to run various SQL queries on the stored data. It provides basic visualization capabilities (such as profit/loss, time series of investment performance, etc.).
